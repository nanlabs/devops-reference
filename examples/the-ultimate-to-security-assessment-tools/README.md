# Welcome to the Security Guide! 🔒

This comprehensive guide is designed to help you integrate security best practices into your development and CI/CD workflows. By "shifting left" 🡪, we aim to detect and fix security vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, ensuring a more secure and robust application. Below, you will find detailed guides and examples for incorporating various security tools and methodologies.

## Why is This Important? 🎯

Integrating security early in the development process helps prevent vulnerabilities from making it into production. This proactive approach, known as "shift left," saves time and resources by addressing issues sooner rather than later. Security is everyone's responsibility, and by embedding it into our workflows, we can achieve a safer and more resilient codebase.

## Tools Covered 🛠️

### [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)

**Snyk** helps developers find, fix, and monitor known vulnerabilities in open source dependencies, container images, and configuration files. It integrates seamlessly with various IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and version control systems. Snyk's user-friendly interface and powerful CLI make it an essential tool for maintaining secure codebases.

### [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)

**Trivy** is a comprehensive and easy-to-use vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts, suitable for scanning code repositories, container images, and even Kubernetes clusters. It provides quick and accurate results, making it a favorite among developers looking to ensure the security of their applications at various stages of development.

### [Super Linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter)

**Super Linter** is a combination of multiple linters to help validate your source code. It ensures that your codebase adheres to best practices and standards, covering a wide range of programming languages and file types. Super Linter can be used both locally and in CI/CD pipelines to maintain code quality and consistency.

### [Mega Linter](https://nvuillam.github.io/mega-linter/)

**Mega Linter** is a powerful linter aggregator that supports numerous languages and formats. It automates the process of running multiple linters, making it easier to maintain high code quality across diverse projects. Mega Linter can be easily integrated into development workflows, ensuring consistent coding standards and early detection of potential issues.

## Guides 📖

We have curated detailed guides and examples to help you integrate these tools into your development workflows.

From code scanning to CI/CD integration, we cover a wide range of topics to enhance the security of your applications.

Let's explore each section:

### [Code Scanning](CODE_SCANNING.md) 🔍

This section covers various types of code scanning tools, including:

- **Filesystem scan**: Scanning the code in repositories.
- **Infra as Code**: Scanning configuration files and infrastructure.
- **Kubernetes**: Ensuring the security of Kubernetes clusters.
- **Container Security**: Scanning Docker containers and images.

Performing regular scans helps in maintaining a secure codebase by identifying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

### [Early Stages of Development Workflows](DEVELOPMENT.md) 🚀

- **IDE Integrations**: Learn how to integrate security tools with popular IDEs like VS Code and JetBrains.
- **Git Workflow**:
  - Using pre-commit and pre-push hooks for security scans.
  - Linter configurations for maintaining code quality and security.
  - Showcasing how to use Super Linter and Mega Linter in your projects.
  - Examples using Husky and Pre-Commit for Git hooks.

By embedding these tools into your development environment, you can catch and fix issues as you write code.

### [Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions](CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION_WITH_GITHUB.md) 🛠️

- How to perform various types of analyses in a CI/CD flow using GitHub Actions.
- Documentation: [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

### [Continuous Integration with GitLab CI/CD](CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION_WITH_GITLAB.md) 🛠️

- Setting up and using GitLab CI/CD for security scans.
- Documentation: [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)

### [Continuous Integration with AWS CodePipeline](CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION_WITH_AWS_CODE_PIPELINE.md) 🛠️

- Integrating security scans in AWS CodePipeline.
- Documentation: [AWS CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/)

Using these CI/CD tools ensures that every change is tested and validated for security issues before being merged and deployed.

## Additional Tools 🛠️

Apart from the tools mentioned above, there are several other tools that can be integrated into your workflows for enhanced security:

- **[Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically)**: Automatically keep your dependencies up to date.
- **[OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/)**: A powerful open-source web application security scanner.
- **[Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/)**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) static analysis tool.
- **[Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**: Security linter for Python.
- **[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/documentation/)**: Continuous inspection of code quality.
