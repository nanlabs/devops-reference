# Serverless Neo4j Deployment

We use Serverless Framework to do production ready deployments.

## Usage

To install this example to bootstrap your project, run the following command:

```sh
npx serverless install -u https://github.com/nanlabs/devops-reference/tree/main/examples/serverless/serverless-neo4j-ec2 -n my-project
```

## Requirements

**You’ll need to have Node 16.13.2 or later on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

```sh
fnm use
npm install
```

Once set you can deploy your app using the serverless framework with:

Then run the following command:

```sh
npm run deploy -- --verbose --stage <stage>
```
